"Mai zyaada bhagu nahi, Raftaar to ek hi"
idk.
glad to reconnect.
Ye dil bechara tasalli bhi chahe kabhi
Ab ke woh aaye toh itni be-dardi se jaaye nahi
Ye dil awaara nikal hi jaata hai kahin
Thehrao nahi
I'm gone again, I'm gone again
Baad-e-saba toh wahi hai bas hai ek kami
Ke ab teri zulfon ko chhu ke woh mujhsay guzarti nahi

must-watch.

bro made a fcking movie.
so do you guys know what is happening with rohan cariappa?
the public's response and support from the artists on this is insane.
i literally thought iss baar ka hustle achha tha.
paid promotions everywhere.

this time it was actually good.

WINDSURF AI CODE EDITOR IS ALL FREE TILL DECEMBER 11TH.
great news.
note to myself: ship as fast as possible.
need to get done with this quiz app by 5th. and then, the speaking app. interesting concept - untapped niche.
thoughts? it will be an app for "fixing introvert's social anxiety" and will ultimately teach you to express through words. using AI ofc. nothing is built without AI these days.
ill gamify it too.
leaderboard and stuff.
wtf, this exists?
i didn't get this anywhere, send me the link or ss.
solving my own problems using code. 🫡
need more info. please.
what should the mvp contain other than the stuff i told about?
how?
ai can now control the terminal too. :cries:
how? i mean, why even? it will be an app to solve social anxiety and ai-ify public speaking with confidence.

bro even got his username as "mafia"
still vibing with "i should've told you when i had the chance"
nice. same $ on 2nd.
bro dropped like 5 songs this year and still is in the top 5 of many people.
emiway ki baat hi chodo, yashraj se piche ho gaya. yashraj is a great artist, dropped albums like Meri Jaan Pehle Naach. but what surprises me is yashraj was way behind emiway.
_kyuki mai na koi role model. mere haath me hai do bottle._
talent wins every time.
talha ki new album suni?
hdv2 suna?
if you haven't, WHY?
Jaisay raat ki raani
Teri chaandni hi to chahte sab

Kya uske bhi seene pe soti ho?
Zulfein hatata hai chehre se tere?
Khush hota hai tere kya hansne pe?
Rota hai kya tere rone se pehle?
Kya usse bhi karti ho baatein fizool ki
Raaton ko sone se pehle?

verse 2:
Kya uske bhi dil se tum khelogi?
Kya woh bhi aise hi raaton ko tadpega?
Main toh hoon shayar, bata deta baatein
Par kambakht woh kaise sambhlega?
Kya uska bhi khane ka mann nahi hoga?
Aur band hoga darwaza kamre ka
Kya woh bhi chhupa lega khud ko andhere mein
Raaton ko karvatein badlega?
yes.
im doing it. making the move.

originally written by jaun elia.
i agree some part of it. (lyrics bohot repeat karta hai)
Mere ghar mein ab ek kamra khaali bhi hai
Wahan se ab hosh hata di gayi hai
Ek saf-e-matam bicha li gayi hai
Us kamre mein ab bas kitaabein hi baaqi hein
Aqal wahan se utha li gayi hai
Nuskha-e-Ishq toh sabko chahiye
Nuskha-e-dard bata dijiye
Jo likhe hein khat woh jala dijiye
Mujhay humdardiyan samajh aati nahi hein
Jo tujh pe beeti tu sab pe ayaan kar
Jo mujh pe beeti woh koi baat hi nahi hai
Judayi mein bhi kuch wafa ke takazay
Ke aib pe parde uthate nahi hein
Ek yaar jiske ghar pe maa hi nahi
Ek mein jo ghar pe raat tha hi nahi
Jo mayassar ho kyun uski chah hi nahi
aur ye uski movie ka gaana hai so, lyrics vaha match karengi.

tu hai nahi, tu hai nahi; tu ho ke bhi, kyu hai nahi?
mai hun vahi, mein hun vahi; ab rehti hai teri kami.

perfection.
the way deepseek has destroyed openai is just straight brutal.
exactly.
india didn't "need" zepto.
it now needs an ai model of its own.
deepseek has truly destroyed the competition.
imagine this: a model better than openai's best ones, at 96x cheaper price, model - open sourced.
they had to even make it open sourced.
its the end bro.
openai too responded by lowering the prices.
but its too late.
haa bhai, bohot cool hai.
🇺🇸 OpenAI:
- 10 years old
- 4,500 employees
- raised $6.6 billion

🇨🇳 DeepSeek
- less than 2 years old
- 200 employees
- less than $10 million capital used

DeepSeek developed and open sourced an equal or better product and have it out for free, likely killing the business model of OpenAI.

from raftaar's verse on gourmet shit:
Ab hai OCB aushadhi OCD ki
Maine seekha ke banda koi OBC nahi
Bache shero ke chaale, nahi lomdi ki
Ab ye vulgarity hai ya equality?
Ke woh bhosdika aur woh bhosdiki
Tera ghar ki hai keemat ye do ghadi ki
Woh bas do ghadi judi thi, dogli thi
Meri chaddi mein phoole, mai mogli nahi
Uska internet punch jisne mockery ki, kya?
listen to moon comes up. bro i never thought seedhe maut would sound so good on a slow beat.
the first half is whole party vibes. the second half is the whole opposite.
second half talks about, nvm, you can just read the first two-three lines:
"when the moon comes up, uski saase races
when the moon comes up, uski chale tez hai
when the moon comes up, vo nahi jati hai akele ghar se bahar kyuki jaan ke badalte bhes hai"
lets gooooo.

story pe to aisa kuch nahi hai.
07/02/25, 5:52 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Hm

basic css. wordpress cms. jquery. php.
sab kuch kharab hai.
i hope its next.js
use v0.dev
for the frontend
and pull it all together.
ngl. this is shit.
learn to use templates to save time too.
use shadcn/ui and customise it for yourself.
bruh, constructive criticism.
and use it and build something!
btw what's this?
.
.
so suddenly when my work paid off, you're saying this?
nice.
just ask v0 bro.
use ui libraries.
customise for your preference.
bruh, "dm seen" and "dee mc"
i would have rhymed that with

d mc (me) - the mic controller
d mf (gaush) - the motherfker.
KSHAMA SUN!!!
nice.

fr.
you can change fonts too. otherwise nice.
choose a minimalistic design from dribbble.
bruh, you don't need to "learn" it.
copy paste of 4 lines and it's done.
refer to the docs.
or just do a simple google / perplexity search.
but i would say one thing. frontend is becoming easier day by day. start building full stack apps. build backend, apis.
frontend can be easily done with v0.dev
bro it's too simple.
im sending a sample nextjs api.
bruh, no. uses claude sonnet on the backend. and renders shadcn on the frontend. on the pro plan, you just add the figma files.
and boom, pixel perfect design there.
use bolt.io or lovable.dev
full stack tools.
*bolt.new
it's like v0 but for full stack dev.
bruh, you said "codes frontend using figma" that's wrong.
"using figma"
bruh, nvm.
you can also start with leetcode.
most of the easy problems are I SWEAR, just a for loop away.
dsa practice site. the thing that will help you the most in your tech interviews.
im already in the top 17% after just 1.5 months.
and then the medium level problems just require you to watch a video and learn that algo.
pro users only.
bruh. im top 2% global on github and top 17% global on leetcode.

vaise ye backend pe ho hi raha hai for the wpm so would be fairly simple to just show it.
yup.
filters bhi daalne honge
- lowercase
- without punctuations
- without the background "ooooohhhs" or something like that
nope.
lyrics.toLowerCase()
and ye saare lyrics synced hai!!!
so i can play the song in the background and encourage the user to type faster.
to listen to the song in a perfect rhythm.
yahi add karna hai.
and the speed of the song will depend on the wpm.
damn, im a genius.
i hope you got it.
yea.
tbh, just add everything that monkey type has.

Hoti inki chaandi par ye toh bas chaahe suna

Hoti inki chaandi par ye toh bas chaahe suna

A double entendre:
1. “Hoti chaandi” as in they would’ve enjoyed the success..“par ye toh bas chaahe Sona” meaning but all they wanna do is sleep.
If intentionally it’s “suna” then it.would mean but I guess they enjoy is suna as in no hustle to get real fans
2. “Hoti chaandi” as in they would’ve enjoyed the silver/success at least… “par ye toh bas chaahe Sona” meaning but they are too fixated over getting just gold – glitz, glamour and how they look.
LOOOOOOL.
COOKED.

bruh, you would not believe i go on dribbble.com, search for minimal portfolio and just copy paste a good ui from there. 🤫
just copying itself is hard.
wtf. built in 1 day. it's pixel perfect to the design, im sharing it.
design me to tha.
pc pe dekho, sahi hai.
yea, tab hi bola tha ek mahina around lagega.
thats called minimal i think.
thanks for that then.
yup. and their product too is the best one.
ok.
fr.
their founder is too humble. their cto is too friendly and engages with the community every now and then. vercel is just too good in everything.
lol, vercel has hired shadcn bro.
the creator of the best ui library in the wordl.
*world.
if you don't know DOGE's website also uses next.js + typescript + shadcn ui.
btw parents are looking to open a d2c brand based on millets.
guess who the cto is.
bad choice tbh.
and its fcking crazy.
listen about the stack first. next.js frontend + wordpress (blogs) + shopify backend.
+ cloudflare + docker. (dev ops stuff)
+ sentry
bug management.
its crazy how shopify directly integrates payments, emails, shop, and overall dashboard.

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
you mean, its okay.
pride kyu dikhana hai?
i will be. when this goes live. till then, im a dumbbeech.

added wordpress blog to this template. im so frustrated rn.
so basically, the code base is setup now. main work starts now.
heavy-lifting done. otherwise this would have taken so many months to build one by one.
i asked chatgpt if he were a client, what price i could charge for the site (animations, microinteractions, sanity cms) and it's saying 60k to 100k. bruh, this is wrong cus i built this in one day. ☠️
my brain all the time now: OPEN SOURCE THIS AS A TEMPLATE.

ok. dibbe me rakh de, deform ho jayega.
yea, ok.
cus they are dumb retards with baap ka paisa.
you didn't.
yea, but keep going bro.
don't stop at one point.
it goes slow. actually too slow.
everything.
next.js + drizzle orm + PostgreSQL + shadcn/ui + vercel + better auth is the best stack rn. (the easiest too)
nice. hows it?
bro this is so relatable - "Did you solve TwoSum in O(n^2)? This is how you can recover."
bruh, why didn't i notice this earlier.


let's listen to this.

"Jab meri duaon mai, tum roz rahi ho zindgi mai fir kyu na reh saki tum
Roz mere khwabon mai jab has rahi ho aake
ankhon se meri fir kyun behrahi tum
Dekho ese na satao ki sach mai maar hi daalo
Mai khudko tumpe khud luta dun jo tum bas pyaar se maango
Daag hain tujhme bhi fir bhi tum mere raat ka chand ho
Manzil tak le chalun tumhe main tum mera sath jo mango"

their interface is shit. i can easily make one easily.

"UnknownContact's messages often revolve around seeking explanations, expressing confusion, or addressing concerns about the relationship."
"They also express a lack of romantic interest."
"In conclusion, the chat data strongly suggests an imbalance in the relationship, with ArjunCodess displaying a significantly higher level of interest and emotional investment than UnknownContact. This is evident in the content, frequency, and emotional tone of their messages."
nope.
abhi nahi.

### **Title Justification**
The title **"With the Photographer"** makes sense because the whole chapter is about the narrator’s experience with a photographer. The word **"with"** shows that the narrator is directly involved in the process. It also hints at a clash between the two. The photographer wants a perfect picture, while the narrator wants to stay real. This title tells us that the story will focus on their interaction. It is simple, clear, and fits the theme.

### **Theme Justification**
The chapter shows a fight between **perfectionism** and **realism**. The photographer wants to edit every detail to make the picture perfect. The narrator does not like this. He believes photos should show real faces, not fake ones. This theme makes us think about how people change things to look better, even when it’s not needed. It also shows how different people see beauty. The photographer sees perfection as beauty, but the narrator sees truth as beauty.
🗣🔥
amanpreet ma'am ne bola hai khud se likhna hai.
to khud bhi likh do.
### **Title Justification**
The title **"With the Photographer"** fits because the story is about the narrator’s time with a photographer. The word **"with"** hints at their interaction and differences. The photographer is **eccentric**, obsessed with **artistic perfection**, while the narrator believes in **self-acceptance** and reality. The title sets up the clash between their views. It also makes readers curious—what happens in this meeting? The simplicity of the title mirrors the narrator’s straightforward thinking, while the deeper meaning reflects the photographer’s need for control over art.

### **Theme Justification**
This chapter highlights the struggle between **artistic perfection** and **self-acceptance**. The photographer is **eccentric**, focusing on fixing every flaw. He believes perfection makes art beautiful. The narrator, however, values reality and self-acceptance. He does not want to hide his true face. This theme shows how people see beauty differently. Some chase perfection, while others embrace their flaws. It also makes us think—should art change reality or show it as it is? The story questions whether perfection is necessary or if being real is enough.
ab thik hai?
sample paper ka hai ig.
idk.
idk. idc.
ok.
ok. i will just feed it the actual text from the textbook.
then it would be alright.
Here are the answers based on the provided text:



1) **Where was the narrator? Why had he gone there? Why do you think that there was a certain pride in the photographer’s manner?**

- The narrator was in a **photo studio** to get his **photograph taken**.

- The photographer showed **a certain pride in his manner** because he had **heavily edited the narrator’s photograph**, altering his features to fit his own artistic vision. He was proud of his editing skills and believed he had improved the narrator’s appearance.



2) **What does the word ‘proof’ mean in this context? Why did the narrator ask, “Is it me?”**

- ‘Proof’ in this context refers to **a trial or test print of the photograph before making the final version**.

- The narrator asked, **“Is it me?”** because the **photographer had drastically changed his facial features**, making him look completely unrecognizable.



3) **Which of the narrator’s facial features had the photographer altered?**

- The photographer had altered the **eyebrows, mouth, ears, and facial hair**.

- He removed the narrator’s original eyebrows and drew new ones, adjusted his mouth, removed facial hair, and even suggested removing his ear to replace it with an artificial one.



4) **What was the only part of the narrator’s face that seemed original in the photograph?**

- Nothing seemed original in the photograph, as **almost every part of his face was edited**. The photographer had changed so much that the narrator no longer recognized himself.



5) **At the end of the story, the narrator flies into a rage. What makes him angry? How would you justify the narrator’s angry outburst?**

- The narrator was **angry** because the **photographer had completely changed his appearance**, prioritizing his editing skills over capturing the narrator’s real face. The narrator had wanted a simple, natural photograph that would remind his friends of him after his death, but the photographer ignored his wishes.

- His **anger is justified** because he felt **disrespected and unseen**—his face was not merely a thing to be fixed but a part of his identity. The photographer's excessive alterations made the narrator feel like a stranger in his own photograph.



Let me know if you need any refinements!

### **1) What did the photographer do? Why was he in the machine only for a second? What was frantic for apparently?**
The photographer rolled a machine into the center of the room and crawled into it from behind. He was inside the machine for only a second because he was adjusting the focus or preparing the camera for the photograph. He appeared frantic because he was concentrating on setting up the shot quickly and efficiently.

### **2) Why did the narrator keep still when the photographer crawled back into the machine again? How did the photographer look when he came out at last?**
The narrator kept still because he thought it was necessary for the photograph to be taken properly. He assumed that any movement might ruin the picture. When the photographer finally came out, he looked satisfied, as if he had completed his work successfully.

### **3) What did the photographer remark about the narrator’s face then? How did the narrator respond? What made him glad?**
The photographer criticized the narrator’s face, pointing out various flaws such as his ears and mouth. He suggested adjusting them to make the portrait look better. The narrator was annoyed and insulted by these remarks but did not argue. He was glad when the session was finally over and he could leave.

### **4) Towards the end of the story, what was the reaction of the narrator on receiving the photograph? Why did he react in such a manner? Why does he call the photograph a ‘worthless bauble’?**
When the narrator received the photograph, he was shocked and disappointed. The photographer had altered his face so much that he could not recognize himself. He reacted with frustration because the photograph did not represent him at all. He called it a ‘worthless bauble’ because it was meaningless to him—it was no longer his real face, just an artificial version created by the photographer.

### **5) What do you think about the photographer from his activities in the extract? Give one reason to support your answer. What is the theme of the story “With the Photographer”?**
The photographer seems overly focused on technical perfection rather than capturing the subject’s true likeness. He is critical and insensitive, making unnecessary changes to the narrator’s face. This shows that he prioritizes his artistic vision over the emotions of his customers.

The theme of the story revolves around **vanity, the unrealistic standards of beauty, and the frustration of not being seen for who we truly are**. It highlights how people try to alter reality to fit an idealized version, often leading to dissatisfaction.

Rabindranath Tagore's short story The Homecoming (also known as "Chhuti") is a moving exploration of childhood, familial love, and the consequences of misunderstanding. Tagore intricately weaves themes of alienation, misjudgment, and the longing for connection in this story about a young boy named Phatik Chakravorti, whose unrestrained, boisterous nature leads him to feel out of place both at home and in society. Here’s an in-depth analysis of the story’s main aspects:

1. Summary and Plot Overview

The story revolves around Phatik, a young boy living in a rural village with his mother and younger brother, Makhan. Phatik is mischievous and free-spirited, often getting into trouble. In an impulsive act, he and his friends push a log into the river, accidentally injuring Makhan. This incident deepens his mother’s dissatisfaction with him.

Phatik’s life changes when his uncle Bishamber visits and offers to take him to the city for a better education. Phatik initially feels excited, imagining a world of new adventures. However, once he moves, he struggles to adapt to urban life, feels alienated in his uncle’s household, and faces constant criticism and rejection from his aunt. Ultimately, he feels homesick and unwanted, leading to his tragic end.


2. Themes

Alienation and Loneliness: Tagore masterfully portrays the theme of alienation through Phatik’s character, who is misunderstood by both his family and society. At home, his mother is harsh and favorably compares him to his younger brother, Makhan. When he moves to the city, he faces even harsher treatment from his aunt and feels out of place in his uncle’s family.

Misjudgment and Misunderstanding: Phatik is misjudged by adults who fail to see the innocence behind his mischief. His mother sees him as a troublemaker, and his aunt considers him a burden. This lack of understanding by adults leads to Phatik’s eventual isolation and suffering.

Longing for Acceptance and Love: Phatik’s actions and his yearning to return home reflect a deep-seated desire for love and belonging. His mother’s lack of affection and his aunt’s rejection fuel his homesickness, leaving him with a sense of emptiness and helplessness.

Childhood and Innocence: Phatik’s actions reflect the innocence of childhood, with his mischief stemming from a natural, unrestrained curiosity. Tagore contrasts the joy and freedom of rural life with the suffocating, restrictive environment of the city, highlighting the loss of innocence in the face of societal expectations.


3. Character Analysis

Phatik Chakravorti: Phatik is a quintessential child — energetic, curious, and mischievous, but also innocent and sensitive. His unintentional antics, such as pushing the log into the river, result in him being labeled a troublemaker. As he confronts rejection and lack of affection from adults, his vulnerability becomes evident. His homesickness and final collapse reveal the fragile nature of a child’s heart when deprived of love and understanding.

Phatik’s Mother: Phatik’s mother is portrayed as a strict, unsympathetic figure who favors Makhan, Phatik’s younger brother. Her lack of patience with Phatik’s unruliness deepens his sense of isolation. While her perspective may stem from her struggles as a widow, she fails to recognize her son’s need for love and guidance.

Uncle Bishamber and Aunt: Bishamber takes Phatik to the city with the intention of providing him with better opportunities, but he is unable to recognize or address Phatik’s emotional struggles. Phatik’s aunt, on the other hand, is openly hostile toward him and perceives him as an intrusion. Her lack of empathy adds to Phatik’s despair.


4. Symbolism

The River and the Log Incident: The river and the log represent freedom, adventure, and Phatik’s uninhibited spirit. The incident with the log sets the stage for his journey, marking the end of his carefree village life and the beginning of his struggles in the city.

This picture shows a village woman carrying a big bundle of harvested crops on her head. She is wearing a traditional dress with beautiful patterns, and her hands are decorated with bangles. The weight of the crops partly hides her face, but her posture shows strength and determination. Behind her, there is a large field of tall plants, showing that she is working on a farm.

This image tells the story of hardworking women in villages. They wake up early, work in the fields, take care of their families, and do household chores. Even though their work is tough, they do it every day without complaining. The bundle on her head is not just crops—it represents her life's heavy responsibilities.

Rama, the woman in the picture, wakes up before sunrise. She cooks for her children, feeds the cattle, and then walks to the fields. Her husband is also a farmer, but his income alone is not enough. So, she helps with harvesting to support the family. Today, she has gathered sugarcane from the farm. The bundle is heavy, but she does not stop. She thinks about her children waiting at home, and that gives her strength.


As she walks back, sweat drips down her face, but she does not stop. The sun is high, and the weight of the bundle presses down on her, yet she keeps moving. Every step she takes is for her family, for the future of her children. She does not have the luxury to rest, but she does not complain.

She knows that her hard work will bring food to the table. No one may praise her, and no one may notice her struggles, but she takes pride in what she does. This picture is not just about farming—it is about the silent strength of women like Rama, who work every day to build a better life for their families.

1. **Rigid Body:**
- A rigid body does not undergo any deformation when a force is applied.
- The force may cause motion (translation or rotation), but the shape and size remain unchanged.
- **Example:** A metal rod or a wooden block.

2. **Non-Rigid Body:**
- A non-rigid body deforms when a force is applied.
- The shape and size change under the influence of force.
- **Example:** A rubber band or a clay ball.

In summary:
- **Rigid bodies experience motion without deformation.**
- **Non-rigid bodies experience both motion and deformation.**

The question in the image asks:

**"What is a neutral point? How is the position of a neutral point located with the help of a compass needle?"**

### **Answer:**
1. **Neutral Point:**
- A neutral point is a location in a magnetic field where the net magnetic field is zero.
- This happens when the magnetic field of an external magnet cancels out the Earth's magnetic field completely.

2. **Locating the Neutral Point Using a Compass Needle:**
- Move a magnetic compass around a bar magnet.
- At the neutral point, the compass needle does not align in any particular direction and stays at rest.
- This indicates that the forces from the external magnet and the Earth's magnetic field are equal and opposite, nullifying each other.

Thus, the neutral point is identified where the compass needle does not show any specific deflection.

Title Justification
The title "With the Photographer" fits because the story is about the narrator’s time with a photographer. The word "with" hints at their interaction and differences. The photographer is eccentric, obsessed with artistic perfection, while the narrator believes in self-acceptance and reality. The title sets up the clash between their views. It also makes readers curious—what happens in this meeting? The simplicity of the title mirrors the narrator’s straightforward thinking, while the deeper meaning reflects the photographer’s need for control over art.

Theme Justification
This chapter highlights the struggle between artistic perfection and self-acceptance. The photographer is eccentric, focusing on fixing every flaw. He believes perfection makes art beautiful. The narrator, however, values reality and self-acceptance. He does not want to hide his true face. This theme shows how people see beauty differently. Some chase perfection, while others embrace their flaws. It also makes us think—should art change reality or show it as it is? The story questions whether perfection is necessary or if being real is enough.
Here are the answers based on the provided text:

1) **Where was the narrator?**
The narrator was in a **photo studio** to get his photograph taken.

2) **Why had he gone there? Why do you think the photographer asked him to sit in the chair?**
He went there to **get a photograph of himself**. The photographer asked him to sit in the chair so he could **adjust his posture and take the picture properly**.

3) **What does the word ‘pivot’ mean in this context? Why did the narrator ask, “Is it my tie?”**
'Pivot' here means **a key point or moment**. The narrator asked, “Is it my tie?” because he thought the photographer was looking for something wrong in his clothing, not his face.

4) **Which of the narrator’s facial features had the photographer attended to?**
The photographer **criticized and changed the narrator’s nose, mouth, eyebrows, ears, and even removed his facial hair**.

5) **What was the only part of the narrator’s face that remained original in the photograph?**
Nothing was original in the photograph. The **photographer had altered everything** about the narrator’s face.

6) **At the end of the story, the narrator tears the photograph and throws it away. What makes him angry? How would you justify the narrator’s anger at the photograph?**
He was angry because **the photographer completely changed his appearance** instead of capturing his real face. He felt like his **true self was erased**. His anger is justified because **he wanted a real memory, not an artificial version of himself**.
nah.
i fed chatgpt the chapter text exact.
bilkul sahi hai. 😂
vo question galat le liya.
sorry.
Here are the answers based on the provided text:

1) **Where was the narrator? Why had he gone there? Why do you think that there was a certain pride in the photographer’s manner?**
- The narrator was in a **photo studio** to get his **photograph taken**.
- The photographer showed **a certain pride in his manner** because he had **heavily edited the narrator’s photograph**, altering his features to fit his own artistic vision. He was proud of his editing skills and believed he had improved the narrator’s appearance.

2) **What does the word ‘proof’ mean in this context? Why did the narrator ask, “Is it me?”**
- ‘Proof’ in this context refers to **a trial or test print of the photograph before making the final version**.
- The narrator asked, **“Is it me?”** because the **photographer had drastically changed his facial features**, making him look completely unrecognizable.

3) **Which of the narrator’s facial features had the photographer altered?**
- The photographer had altered the **eyebrows, mouth, ears, and facial hair**.
- He removed the narrator’s original eyebrows and drew new ones, adjusted his mouth, removed facial hair, and even suggested removing his ear to replace it with an artificial one.

4) **What was the only part of the narrator’s face that seemed original in the photograph?**
- Nothing seemed original in the photograph, as **almost every part of his face was edited**. The photographer had changed so much that the narrator no longer recognized himself.

5) **At the end of the story, the narrator flies into a rage. What makes him angry? How would you justify the narrator’s angry outburst?**
- The narrator was **angry** because the **photographer had completely changed his appearance**, prioritizing his editing skills over capturing the narrator’s real face. The narrator had wanted a simple, natural photograph that would remind his friends of him after his death, but the photographer ignored his wishes.
- His **anger is justified** because he felt **disrespected and unseen**—his face was not merely a thing to be fixed but a part of his identity. The photographer's excessive alterations made the narrator feel like a stranger in his own photograph.

Let me know if you need any refinements!
ab sahi hai?
likh liye>
?
answers check karke bata sahi hai ya nahi.
### **1) What did the photographer do? Why was he in the machine only for a second? What was frantic for apparently?**
The photographer rolled a machine into the center of the room and crawled into it from behind. He was inside the machine for only a second because he was adjusting the focus or preparing the camera for the photograph. He appeared frantic because he was concentrating on setting up the shot quickly and efficiently.

### **2) Why did the narrator keep still when the photographer crawled back into the machine again? How did the photographer look when he came out at last?**
The narrator kept still because he thought it was necessary for the photograph to be taken properly. He assumed that any movement might ruin the picture. When the photographer finally came out, he looked satisfied, as if he had completed his work successfully.

### **3) What did the photographer remark about the narrator’s face then? How did the narrator respond? What made him glad?**
The photographer criticized the narrator’s face, pointing out various flaws such as his ears and mouth. He suggested adjusting them to make the portrait look better. The narrator was annoyed and insulted by these remarks but did not argue. He was glad when the session was finally over and he could leave.

### **4) Towards the end of the story, what was the reaction of the narrator on receiving the photograph? Why did he react in such a manner? Why does he call the photograph a ‘worthless bauble’?**
When the narrator received the photograph, he was shocked and disappointed. The photographer had altered his face so much that he could not recognize himself. He reacted with frustration because the photograph did not represent him at all. He called it a ‘worthless bauble’ because it was meaningless to him—it was no longer his real face, just an artificial version created by the photographer.

### **5) What do you think about the photographer from his activities in the extract? Give one reason to support your answer. What is the theme of the story “With the Photographer”?**
The photographer seems overly focused on technical perfection rather than capturing the subject’s true likeness. He is critical and insensitive, making unnecessary changes to the narrator’s face. This shows that he prioritizes his artistic vision over the emotions of his customers.

The theme of the story revolves around **vanity, the unrealistic standards of beauty, and the frustration of not being seen for who we truly are**. It highlights how people try to alter reality to fit an idealized version, often leading to dissatisfaction.

and that too in the worst possible way.
nvm, why am i even ranting about this?
fr. 😂
and we all know what was actually the story going on.
well that girl. she ain't a girl. she is a devil.
damn, she came into my life, ruined it and went away.
like wtf girl. what is wrong with you.
she used to literally pull up the female card on me. and i didn't even say "NO" to her.

and after all the things happened, then came the final hit.
and you know what was the "final hit"
kabhi kuch kaha tha kya usse?
meri bhi yahi galati thi.
wth? ye kab kahani me hua?
vo dono khud conflict me the.
remember, ak usse baat nahi kar rahi thi, idk what reason, so she used to come to me and pull the victim card?
vo dono khud confusion me the. lol. 😂

Tumhari vajah se mujhe aaj tak kabhi Bura nahi laga
To kya hua? Ab aadat hai
Phir se Bata Raha hu ye jhuth nahi tha, aur mujhe tumhari yaad aati hai, koi replacement nahi hai
I'm still wondering how can you even think of me getting a replacement
Maine ye nahi kaha ki Mai tumhari vajah se marna chahta hu, Maine ye kaha ki mai inn halato ki vajah se marna chahta hu
Nah, galat hai
Nah! Maine Abhi puri baat hi nahi batayi hai

5) bhut akela sa feel ho Raha hai, Aisa lag Raha hai ki koi aisa hai hi nahi jisko Mai kuch Bata saku
6) phone Gaya
7) Mummy computer bhi band karvane wali hai 😭😭
Annwita wala 🙂

Today, I faced a very challenging and unexpected situation that shook me to the core. My best friend, Mishika, with whom I shared everything, suddenly blocked me and stopped communicating with me. This was a huge blow to me, and I felt lost and alone. I couldn't understand what had gone wrong, and why she had chosen to cut me off completely. I tried to reach out to her, but all my attempts went in vain.

Despite my efforts, the situation remained the same, and I was forced to confront the idea that our friendship might be over. This realisation was difficult to accept, and I found myself struggling to come to terms with it. However, with time, I learned that sometimes, people come into our lives for a reason, and when that reason is fulfilled, they move on. (future: however this wasn’t true at all)

This experience taught me many valuable lessons about life and relationships. I realized that it's important to appreciate the people in our lives while we have them, and not take them for granted. I also learned that we can't control the actions of others, but we can control how we respond to them.

Despite the pain and confusion that I felt, I decided to focus on my own well-being and take care of myself. Though I still miss Mishika and hope to see her again someday, I am grateful for the memories we shared, and for the people who have remained by my side through thick and thin.

I was feeling so down and alone that I decided to revisit the old conversations that I had with my dear friend and crush Mishika. As I went through them, the memories brought tears to my eyes. It was so hard to accept that someone who had played such an important role in my life was suddenly gone.

I had never imagined that our friendship would come to such an abrupt end. Mishika had been my confidante, my crush, and my rock. We had shared everything with each other, from our deepest secrets to our wildest dreams. She was the one person who understood me better than anyone else.

proud of my own mother 🫡
Shiksha Ma'am scolding me for giggling
Me still giggling 
Shiksha Ma'am :- vo bevakuf abhi bhi has raha hai
meanwhile inner shiksha ma'am :- ego hurt kar diya
haa ma'am was speechless

Ab kare to kare kya?
Khush rehne ki koshish Karu to past yaad aajata hai, parents ki daat yaad aajati hai
How do you know all this?
Not only Think I look at that person when I feel like this and it leaves a big smile on my face, that's you ❤️

This was literally funny 😂

Səni sevirəm <3
Hi

tbh i decided not to text you today and see when the message will come from your side
ik you passed
you have been offline for 3 hours I knew there would be some reason
ohk
aur batao
btw see this
vo bhi kya din the!
un dino bhooto se dar lagta tha, attachment se nahi (my inner mind: kya dialogue bola hai wah!)
vaise sahi bhi hai
aur batao, hows everything going? all good?
kyu kya hua?
aaj suresh sir ne daat diya?
totally true
arre dil pe lo, sometimes daat bhi kha leni chahiye
koi na, ab normal hojayega
aaj suresh sir ka mood off tha isliye
koi baat nahi yr, dil pe mat lo
chill yr, abhi to aur daat khani hai zindagi me - prepare hojao
ye sunke mujhe bhi ajeeb laga tha
its okay girl
don't be so emotional girl you have spent your hardest nights not even telling your parents, you are strong enough
we both are and we both know it
lets just talk out things, theres nothing to be so emotional on this small thing
wth why u didn't tell me? jitna khush school me rehti ho uska ulta ghar pe?
whyyyyy?
i am so sorry, i didn't notice
lets talk about it first
?
but why?
whats the reason behind this?
what led to this
?
it has been happening from how long?
more than 2 weeks?
if it happens for long than i am pretty sure why only u r able to understand me, cause you are the same (if it happens for more than 2 weeks then its termed as depression [the fight in the mind])
i know you know this
please try to get out of this
try everything, i can't see you like this
*or rather "teen depression"
please!
its even more worse than it seems
i know anger issues hote hai aur muh se kuch bhi nikal jata hai
wth kis baat pe?
to tumne kya bola?
bhut achha kiya
akal to aayi hogi kam se kam
isme show off kya kar diya?
aapne kya bola?
😂😂🫡🫡🫠🫠
bhut sahi 🫡

tbh it doesn't seem from your smile all day
thanks for your prayers, she's good
am i getting boring?
it seems, nobody likes to talk to me now
*offline
*online me bhi bas 3 log hai
You, Plaksha, Ishaan
i have my exam on 15th
im tensed
PW SAT (physics wallah - scholarship admission test)
8th ka pura syllabus aayega
i have not even completed 1/2 of the syllabus
wait did i tell you about this?
tbh i am loving and hating my life at this moment (loving cus no one is there to talk to me and hating cusno one is there to talk to me)
idk pata nahi kuch bhi thoughts aarahe hai dimag me
nightmares aarahe hai
i was just sitting at my seat and then dekhte hi dekhte the world starts to fall and break into pieces but only I am falling from the clouds, everybody else is just at there position laughing, giggling
and also i also break into pieces and I realise I'm gonna die and then I wake ip
*up
your too, but u r not gonna tell it 🥲
thats the worst lie you will say to yourself
i know it happens, don't worry i think someone is your friend who has already experienced it before and is requesting you to not get into this
calm down calm down, yes i know anger issues bhi hote hai
you just have to find out a way which will help you getting out of this
i don't think you will struggle in finding a way 'cus you got soo many and soo good friends
chalo byeeeee

kissi dost se bhi baat karo to heart beat tez ho jati hai, agar baat nahi karto to "humare liye time nahi hai", baat karo to "bhut bolte ho"
upar se kal assembly hai
arre almost sab
ab kare to kare kya
matlab baat bhi nahi karu?
thats cold 🥶
vaise aaj ek gadbad hogyi
arre i didn;t mean that
bus me chill kar raha tha aur soch raha tha ghar me konsi personality rakhni hai phir
_noise_
Me: _hears a hello bro, can't believe its true_
He: bhaiya konsi class me?
Me: shows up middle finger
He2: arre bhaiya ka savage reply
Me: savage gaya bhad me, muh sambhal ke baat kiya karo
He: maine kuch kaha hi nahi abhi to?
_ a girl shows up _
He2: bhaiya ye puch rahi hai "mere saath sex karoge"
Me: fuck off bitch
She: mazak tha yr, serious mat lena
Me: but mai serious tha samjhi? bhak..
idk ye maine kaise bol diya
idk
mujhe aur dost nahi banane
maine gadbad kar di "how to win friends and influence people" padh ke
abhi tak yaad hai is book ki vajah se dost banane ka motivation aaya tha 6th me
vo chota nahi lag raha tha
shayad bada tha, vo mujhe senior samajh ke "bhaiya" bol raha tha 😂
baato se to vo 8th ka hi lag raha tha
idk i am now feeling sorry for them
thoda achhe se baat kar leni chahiye thi
lagta hai galati se personality choose karne me - gusse wali choose kar li
nahi to
kyu
?
tbh i agree but bol nahi sakta
itna kya kar diya? itna gussa kaise?
*cope
same i was thinking
kya bhadka diya?
actually jaadu hi hai
arrre arre bas control controllll
arre ha, lekin phir ruk gayi idk why
control control, at the end of the day tumhari hi dost hai classmate hai
tbh its good to see this one 😳
सुधार कार्य
tbh i get the same thoughts par kuch bolta nahi
uss din ke baad to isse baat karne ka man nahi karta par kya kare
sahi bol rahi ho, but yr thoda uske baare me bhi socho
ho sakta hai

ek din to mujhse boli thi, "tum ghoomne jaane wale the, mujhe kyu nahi bataya?"
no sense?!
vahi to, kuch close dosto ko bataya tha bas, you, agrim, pratyush and akshra
she thinks uski ye condition tumhari vajah se hui hai, to tumhe hi sudharna hoga, no logic?!
tbh aaj to ishaan uske behalf pe request karne aaya tha ki "plz mai tumhare saath baith jau? (physics period me)"
mujhse yr
to aur kon ho sakta hai?
i couldn't believe ishaan iski baat maan raha hai
plus vo paper bhi ishaan ne hi diya tha
kal puchta hu usse

Good Morning
You have Philophobia
?
Mujhse Laga tha
Kya pata sach bhi ho sakta hai
Agar itne saare reasons na hote to conclusion nahi niklta
Wait, trying to remember the date
23th April - When I came to you to talk about that movie thing, you were constantly trying to run away, not even listening to what I was saying
24th April - 
Me: I'm sorry Mai tumse baat nahi kar pa Raha
You: mujhe farak nahi padta
Me: haa tumhe to koi interest hi nahi hai

Agar Maine text karna band kar diya to tumne bhi band kar diya

You didn't even care to ask why

You only reply to my messages, that's it

You can't even start a conversation
did you tell me?
ooohhh, got it
it is
konse "rumor"?
another proof you don't want to talk to me
kya?
kya explain kar rahi ho apne aap ko?
iska reply
hain? kon?? 😡
naam batao
to?
what kind of awkwardness?
pehle awkward feel hota tha?
i wanted to tell you something
day by day, i have started losing feelings for you,although all my efforts were going in vein I tried hard but now I've lost them
haa?
??
No never but my care was becoming a prison for u.. sahi keh raha hu na??
kuch bhi???
tbh im getting these constant thoughts that I was never worthy for you and I'll never be, even to be your best friend
i think you should get someone better
no i was thinking the opposite of this, you are too gud for me 😳
but i literally think you should get someone better as your bff
why?
i was becoming overprotective for you and ofc you didn't like it
Sorry i was offline for a sec
That's what, you never needed me
It never felt like tbh
There are infinite possibilities, you'll surely find someone
Kya kar sakte hai, pyaar Insaan Ko pagal kar deta hai 😔
English TV series me dekha tha, Hindi me translate kar diya 😂
Vaise bhi baat to sach hi hai
Some things can't be fixed after being broken
Thank u for making me realize that I shouldn't hv loved u more  than myself
Bye, ab baat karne ka man nahi hai
Yea, I'd love to 😘
You don't need to force
After everything I am here for you ❤️
Let's start again, BFFs 4ever
I see I never lost feelings for you it was just, I was feeling so bad after coming to the conclusion that u don't like talking to me(not true)
I still love you and will love you forever
No? Bout what?
she wants to talk to me?
👍
Can we?
You've seen everything going on
It was just I thought I lost feelings for you and was feeling a little sad because of our past offline conversations
Just this
And because of this I started to ignore you(which I'm regretting now)
Hey

i am sorry for that photo thing, this wouldn't be repeated, i never intended to make up a bad image of myself in front of you, please forgive me, I have already deleted that photo from my phone
really? on what topic?
will continue this tomorrow
let me guess, you don’t want to read the whole of it? ik, so here's a summary of it - Happy Birthday Mishika! You are the most beautiful girl I know of or I could think of and, you are just really worthy🌟 of anything in the world.

^^main message starts here^^

after staying with you for an year and a half, I can surely say you, yes YOU! are just too good✨! like for everything, I have noticed you excel in everything, like literally how can anyone balance everything? i just love these personality traits in you - loving, caring, annoying(sometimes), humorous(all-times, you need to accept it) and understanding(I don’t need to explain this one)🙌. you know? i used to share my deepest secrets to our wildest dreams (I mean everything, in short, actually i told the right person who helped me in my dark times), remember 9th Feb? let me give you a hint - 🍫! one thing is sure, i don't think i will ever get the same vibes with anyone else i got from you! thanks for that too

i can’t stop myself from mentioning that you were looking so gorgeous today 💁👗!

at the end I just want to say - THANK YOU! for coming into my life and SORRY! for everything wrong I have done. 

Happy Birthday Mishika! you truly deserve all the wonders this world has to offer. and I wish you another year of prosperity, happiness, and peace (mentally and physically). after all, your birthday is the first day of another 365-day journey - make it memorable!

I never took you for granted and lived every moment with you like it was an extra. I thank you for coming into my life and making it a better one.

Happy Birthday Mishika! 🎉🎂
Yea?
Hola! 👋

Let's start with the most obvious but not so obvious things - it's 177 days since we spoke to each other. Not so obvious, right? 

Now with the obvious and obvious things. I know you think that I never loved you seriously but that is literally not true! You think I'm a playboy but trust me I really love u more than I do for myself. Aur ab tumhe lagega ki mai ye har ladki se kehta hu lekin nahi ye sirf tumhare liye hi h. Kasam se aise text kisi ko nahi kiye aur agar maine kiya bhi hai toh voh sab mazaak tha but what I did for u were my true feelings. Ab ye mat sochna ki mai tumhe blame kar raha hu,  I'm resolving the misconceptions you had about me. 

This is gotta be strange for you but I STILL have a crush on you. Ah yes, let me guess your reaction "iss sab ke baad bhi? Pagal ho kya?". Haa mai hu... 

You don't need to apologize for anything. You're just perfect the way you are. Never let anyone destroy that. That's your personal brand. That's what you are. A lovely sweet girl. 

A long time ago you asked me if I really had "edit videos" of you on my phone, as you guessed I said no and tried everything to oppose the situation. But there's a different story going on here.

It feels like a year ago the last time I saw you. I know you weren't in tune the last time I called you. I hope that you think of me. I'm just a normal boy who is afraid of showing his emotions, afraid of making new friends, afraid of connecting with people, afraid of feeling what I felt for you again.

I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable. I know very well you are independent and I should've respected that. 

I don't think I will ever get the same feelings with anyone else I got from you. Thanks for everything!

Countless letters, rhyming poems, edit videos, photos, and what not! All these things sing the same song. 

Wanna hear it? 

I love you Mishika ❣️
I told my mother about you! I knew the feelings I had for you were permanent❤️
Ye sab kya hai? 😌🙊
Or was it just that you liked me that time?
But that's what love is
Umm.. Do you still hate me?
Seems like we have a common enemy
I can't thank you enough for talking today! I just can't express.. 

Thank you so much!
We will continue this some other time
Happy Birthday, Diy- Mishika! (I’ve lost the authority to say that) 🎉🎂

And yes, I know I'm an hour and 22 minutes early.

Of course, the summary comes before anything else — Happy Birthday, Mishika. You are the most beautiful girl I know of or could think of, and you truly deserve everything wonderful in the world. I wanted to take a moment to share something heartfelt with you.

^^^ main message starts here ^^^

From the time we’ve spent together, I’ve realized just how amazing you are. Your character, your smile, and the way you bring light into every room (of course, your nickname very well suggests that) — it’s all truly awesome. ✨

I’ve always felt like I should’ve told you how much you mean to me when I had the chance. 🎈

(continued...)
(continued...)

Thinking back on our memories, I realize that I wanted to hold you close in a hopeless romance, and now, I see how you’ve become a part of my dreams. Quite literally, I have a version of you who talks to me when I’m feeling down. And yes, I named her — I know you know it very well!

“I told my mother about you! I knew the feelings I had for you were permanent.” ❤️

I’ve faced my own struggles, fears and nightmares, and sometimes I’ve found it hard to sleep because I was afraid of losing you. I never wanted it to end — that connection between us. 🌙

So today, on your birthday, THANK YOU for being a part of my life. You have meant more to me than words can express. I just can’t mind myself saying this to you.

I’m REALLY SORRY for any pain I may have caused, and I hope you can forgive me. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I wish you a year filled with love, joy, and everything your heart desires. 💖

I know I'm being needy and it feels awkward, but all my attention is fixed on you and I actually can’t help it. I know that my actions might come off as strange, and I’m pretty sure you don’t want to read this. I don’t even blame you, but please open the link attached. I’ve got something I want to show you. This has taken me more than 40 hours to build, writing the code line by line. I hope you will like it. 💌

And a few points to mention: open it after midnight and there will be something special on the homepage. At the bottom is a game sort of, so make sure to play and click on the button that opens, and then on the last page of the memories — there is something special, very special. Thanks.

Happy Birthday, Diy… not again!
Happy Birthday, Mishika! or should I say, the perfect creation of God? 🎂

I hope your day is as wonderful as you are, and that the year ahead is filled with all the incredible things you deserve.

With all my love, from the boy you hate — to a girl I care deeply about,
Best wishes for your special day,
Arjun.
