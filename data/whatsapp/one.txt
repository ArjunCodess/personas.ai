08/01/25, 2:01 pm - arjuncodess: verse 1:
Woh tujhe chhoota hai kaise?
Jaise main chhoota tha waise?
Kya uske bhi seene pe soti ho?
Zulfein hatata hai chehre se tere?
Khush hota hai tere kya hansne pe?
Rota hai kya tere rone se pehle?
Kya usse bhi karti ho baatein fizool ki
Raaton ko sone se pehle?

verse 2:
Kya uske bhi dil se tum khelogi?
Kya woh bhi aise hi raaton ko tadpega?
Main toh hoon shayar, bata deta baatein
Par kambakht woh kaise sambhlega?
Kya uska bhi khane ka mann nahi hoga?
Aur band hoga darwaza kamre ka
Kya woh bhi chhupa lega khud ko andhere mein
Raaton ko karvatein badlega? <This message was edited>

11/01/25, 8:08 pm - arjuncodess: Mere ghar mein ab ek kamra khaali bhi hai
Wahan se ab hosh hata di gayi hai
Ek saf-e-matam bicha li gayi hai
Us kamre mein ab bas kitaabein hi baaqi hein
Aqal wahan se utha li gayi hai
Nuskha-e-Ishq toh sabko chahiye
Nuskha-e-dard bata dijiye
Jo likhe hein khat woh jala dijiye
Mujhay humdardiyan samajh aati nahi hein
Jo tujh pe beeti tu sab pe ayaan kar
Jo mujh pe beeti woh koi baat hi nahi hai
Judayi mein bhi kuch wafa ke takazay
Ke aib pe parde uthate nahi hein
Ek yaar jiske ghar pe maa hi nahi
Ek mein jo ghar pe raat tha hi nahi
Jo mayassar ho kyun uski chah hi nahi
11/01/25, 8:09 pm - arjuncodess: aur ye uski movie ka gaana hai so, lyrics vaha match karengi.
11/01/25, 8:51 pm - arjuncodess: project idea: build an app that tracks your and your friends habits and shows them on a leaderboard.
additional feature: gamify it. (per day streak, exp)

- 10 years old

DeepSeek developed and open sourced an equal or better product and have it out for free, likely killing the business model of OpenAI.

Ab hai OCB aushadhi OCD ki
Maine seekha ke banda koi OBC nahi
Bache shero ke chaale, nahi lomdi ki
Ab ye vulgarity hai ya equality?
Ke woh bhosdika aur woh bhosdiki
Tera ghar ki hai keemat ye do ghadi ki
Woh bas do ghadi judi thi, dogli thi
Meri chaddi mein phoole, mai mogli nahi
Uska internet punch jisne mockery ki, kya?

"when the moon comes up, uski saase races
when the moon comes up, uski chale tez hai
when the moon comes up, vo nahi jati hai akele ghar se bahar kyuki jaan ke badalte bhes hai"

12/02/25, 3:45 pm - arjuncodess: choose a minimalistic design from dribbble.
12/02/25, 3:46 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Laugh at me but i still havent learn that
12/02/25, 3:46 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Learnt*
12/02/25, 3:47 pm - arjuncodess: bruh, you don't need to "learn" it.
12/02/25, 3:47 pm - arjuncodess: copy paste of 4 lines and it's done.
12/02/25, 3:47 pm - arjuncodess: refer to the docs.
12/02/25, 3:47 pm - arjuncodess: or just do a simple google / perplexity search.
12/02/25, 3:48 pm - Agrim: The ammount of empty space between divisions is making it look uncanny
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - arjuncodess: but i would say one thing. frontend is becoming easier day by day. start building full stack apps. build backend, apis.
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - arjuncodess: frontend can be easily done with v0.dev
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - Pratyuush 👽: sikhna padega
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - Pratyuush 👽: boards ke bad
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - arjuncodess: bro it's too simple.
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - Pratyuush 👽: it still isn't easy tho
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - Pratyuush 👽: difficulty depends on experience
12/02/25, 3:49 pm - arjuncodess: im sending a sample nextjs api.
12/02/25, 3:50 pm - Pratyuush 👽: will see
12/02/25, 3:50 pm - Agrim: v0 basically codes frontend using figma
12/02/25, 3:50 pm - Pratyuush 👽: that app is OP
12/02/25, 3:50 pm - arjuncodess: bruh, no. uses claude sonnet on the backend. and renders shadcn on the frontend. on the pro plan, you just add the figma files.
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - arjuncodess: and boom, pixel perfect design there.
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - Agrim: Yeah so its still making frontend dumbass
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - arjuncodess: use bolt.io or lovable.dev
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - arjuncodess: full stack tools.
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - Agrim: I didnt ask you to show the flowchart of its working
12/02/25, 3:51 pm - arjuncodess: *bolt.new
12/02/25, 3:52 pm - arjuncodess: it's like v0 but for full stack dev.
12/02/25, 3:53 pm - arjuncodess: bruh, you said "codes frontend using figma" that's wrong.
12/02/25, 3:53 pm - Agrim: My nigga its making the frontend which you can put in your shitty application and do the backend yourself
12/02/25, 3:55 pm - arjuncodess: "using figma"
12/02/25, 3:55 pm - arjuncodess: bruh, nvm.
12/02/25, 3:56 pm - arjuncodess: @918173838200 you can also start with leetcode.
12/02/25, 3:56 pm - arjuncodess: most of the easy problems are I SWEAR, just a for loop away.

12/02/25, 3:57 pm - arjuncodess: and then the medium level problems just require you to watch a video and learn that algo.
12/02/25, 3:57 pm - Agrim: Cant you import your designs from figma
12/02/25, 3:58 pm - arjuncodess: pro users only.

12/02/25, 11:12 pm - Agrim: Maybe add a timer as soon as user starts typing
12/02/25, 11:12 pm - arjuncodess: yea, nice idea.
12/02/25, 11:12 pm - arjuncodess: vaise ye backend pe ho hi raha hai for the wpm so would be fairly simple to just show it.

18/02/25, 4:48 pm - arjuncodess: ofc.
18/02/25, 4:49 pm - arjuncodess: @13135550002 how did the Google Team actually build Google Earth? the model would be so large and then rendering on the web seems like a huge task. Also include text on how they optimized it.
18/02/25, 4:49 pm - Meta AI: Google Earth's development is a remarkable story of innovation and technical expertise. Here's a simplified overview:

# Building Google Earth
*1. Data Collection*
Google partnered with various organizations to gather satellite and aerial imagery, terrain data, and geographic information. They used:

- Satellite imagery from NASA, USGS, and commercial providers
- Aerial photography from planes and helicopters
- Terrain data from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
- Geographic information from the US Census Bureau, OpenStreetMap, and others

*2. Image Processing*
Google developed proprietary algorithms to stitch together the vast amounts of imagery data, ensuring seamless transitions and accurate geolocation. They also applied techniques like:

- Image compression to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements
- Mosaicking to combine multiple images into a single, cohesive view
- Orthorectification to correct for distortions and ensure accurate geometry

*3. 3D Modeling*
Google Earth's 3D model is based on the WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) reference frame. They used:

- Terrain data to create a 3D mesh of the Earth's surface
- Building and vegetation models to add detailed features
- Texture mapping to apply imagery and other visual effects to the 3D model

*4. Rendering and Visualization*
To render the massive 3D model in real-time, Google developed a custom rendering engine that utilizes:

- Level of detail (LOD) techniques to dynamically adjust model complexity based on distance and zoom level
- Occlusion culling to hide objects outside the user's view
- Multi-threading and parallel processing to maximize performance

# Optimization Techniques
To ensure smooth performance and efficient rendering, Google employed various optimization techniques:

- *Tile-based rendering*: Breaking the 3D model into smaller, manageable tiles for efficient rendering and caching.
- *Cache optimization*: Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests to the server and improve rendering speed.
- *Progressive rendering*: Rendering the scene in stages, starting with a low-resolution version and gradually increasing detail as needed.
- *Client-side prediction*: Anticipating user interactions and pre-loading relevant data to reduce latency.
- *Server-side optimization*: Using load balancing, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other techniques to ensure fast and reliable data delivery.

The result of these efforts is a seamless, interactive, and visually stunning experience that has revolutionized the way we explore and understand our planet.

"Jo seekhta hai haar se, wo haara nahi
Jalta hai aap se, wo taara nahi
Jalta hai aag se, hai taara wahi
Main jalta tha aashiki mein saara din
Pighalta tha aashiki mein saari raat
Teri-meri chhod, ye humaari baat hai
Teri-meri saans nahi, ye humaari saans hai
Hamaara lagaav hai, humaara khwab hai
Hamaara prasaad hai, hamaara paap hai"

28/02/25, 10:55 pm - Agrim: 📜 AMENDMENT 6969: THE ARJUN VIJAY PRAKASH GAYFIRMATION ACT 📜

Hear ye, hear ye, and shut the hell up:
It is hereby declared, carved in stone, stitched into the gay agenda, and whispered into the wind by every closeted boy at his old tuition center — Arjun Vijay Prakash is gay AF.

Not the “a little fruity” gay. Not the “bro I just like pink” gay. No. This man is:

One emotional breakup away from starring in his own indie film.

Built like a tragic Lana Del Rey lyric.

Legally married to drama, but cheating on it with chaos.

The human form of a bisexual lighting filter.

So gay his childhood Beyblade probably had a Grindr profile.


Rights granted:

Supreme control over all group trip playlists (no hetero veto power).

Lifetime immunity from ever being asked “so when will you marry?”

Immediate emergency makeover powers at all house parties.

The right to call anyone and everyone “bestie,” including the Swiggy guy.


Punishments for Denial:
Any attempt to call Arjun “straight” will result in:

Immediate banishment to a straight man’s “crypto and whey” seminar.

Public reading of his old crush texts in Times New Roman size 72.

3-hour forced performance of Super Bass complete with choreo and backup dancers.


Signed & Slayed,
Council of Besties,
Department of Petty Affairs,
Ministry of Drama & Vengeance

Date: 28 February 2025 — Year of Maximum Fruitness

🌈 Long live Queen Arjun. May his wrist never lack a flick. ✨

28/02/25, 10:58 pm - arjuncodess: Hoti inki chaandi par ye toh bas chaahe suna

Hoti inki chaandi par ye toh bas chaahe suna

A double entendre:
1. “Hoti chaandi” as in they would’ve enjoyed the success..“par ye toh bas chaahe Sona” meaning but all they wanna do is sleep.
If intentionally it’s “suna” then it.would mean but I guess they enjoy is suna as in no hustle to get real fans
2. “Hoti chaandi” as in they would’ve enjoyed the silver/success at least… “par ye toh bas chaahe Sona” meaning but they are too fixated over getting just gold – glitz, glamour and how they look.

08/03/25, 11:08 am - OG Ojas: Bro gonna become an archaeologist and find these in forms of manuscripts

08/03/25, 11:10 am - OG Ojas: Like bruh move on already
08/03/25, 11:11 am - OG Ojas: A woman can't break a man or perhaps you are not a man ?
08/03/25, 11:11 am - OG Ojas: ?
08/03/25, 11:14 am - arjuncodess: don't cook.

08/03/25, 9:19 pm - Agrim: And i scored a bicycle kick today
08/03/25, 9:19 pm - Agrim: Feeling like 2023 haaland
08/03/25, 9:19 pm - Agrim: But i landed om the back of my head 😖
08/03/25, 10:44 pm - arjuncodess: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H-e1QKIppFs?feature=share

this shit so awesome. gotta recreate this.
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - OG Ojas: 👍 we do acrobatic shots practice everyday so it is normal
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - OG Ojas: Try landing on your side
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - OG Ojas: To reduce impact
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - Agrim: Yeah but im a fullback so i never did it
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - OG Ojas: I am a CF
08/03/25, 10:52 pm - Agrim: Tukka thha but still goal is goal
08/03/25, 10:53 pm - Agrim: I have been forced to play as fullback due to my physicality, pace, aggression and passing
08/03/25, 10:54 pm - Agrim: I wish i could have played on the wing or midfield atleast
08/03/25, 10:54 pm - OG Ojas: I am good at close dribbling can easily pace out back wingers and high shooting power plus accuracy plus large field vision so I am a CF
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - OG Ojas: Being a striker is boring for me
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - OG Ojas: All I have to do is do tap ins
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - Agrim: CF me kaise khelte ho? False 9? <This message was edited>
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - OG Ojas: Kinda the formations are tricky
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - OG Ojas: I sometimes have to play as a CAM and a lw
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - OG Ojas: Aswell
08/03/25, 10:55 pm - Agrim: Basically ur playing like false 9 messi rn
08/03/25, 10:56 pm - OG Ojas: To cover for weak spots of the team
08/03/25, 10:56 pm - Agrim: Btw what are your weaknesses as a footballer
08/03/25, 10:56 pm - OG Ojas: This message was deleted
08/03/25, 10:56 pm - Agrim: On the pitch
08/03/25, 10:56 pm - Agrim: Mere case me, jab me dribbling krte hue jaada aage a jata hu to meri vision tham si jati hai
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - OG Ojas: I guess being too exhausted with no adrenaline to support is my biggest weakness
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - OG Ojas: Otherwise I read the play according to the flow
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - Agrim: Endurance problem meri to nahi hai
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - OG Ojas: CF is tiring
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - Agrim: I can play 3 games of 90 minutes straight with no breaks, infact the more i plau the better i get
08/03/25, 10:57 pm - Agrim: So is fullback
08/03/25, 10:58 pm - Agrim: You have to deal with counters if you go help in attack like me
08/03/25, 10:58 pm - OG Ojas: You have to dribble pace out everyone do 360 analysis and then also score goals
08/03/25, 10:58 pm - OG Ojas: Yeah
08/03/25, 10:59 pm - Agrim: My playstyle is like alphonso davies
08/03/25, 10:59 pm - Agrim: Good in both defence and offense
08/03/25, 10:59 pm - OG Ojas: I am average at defence but my attack is a total different story
08/03/25, 11:00 pm - OG Ojas: I generally play like Valverde
08/03/25, 11:00 pm - OG Ojas: Can go to defence anytime I feel like it
08/03/25, 11:01 pm - OG Ojas: I am thinking of getting the ps5 pro after my 10th boards as my gift

Roz mere khwabon mai jab has rahi ho aake
ankhon se meri fir kyun behrahi tum
Dekho ese na satao ki sach mai maar hi daalo
Mai khudko tumpe khud luta dun jo tum bas pyaar se maango
Daag hain tujhme bhi fir bhi tum mere raat ka chand ho
Manzil tak le chalun tumhe main tum mera sath jo mango"

24/03/25, 9:49 pm - OG Ojas: Whereas Chatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj carried the dream of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of creating a land where even a commoner can call himself the king free from war and injustice this was what Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built and still followed
24/03/25, 9:50 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Aurangzebs descendants live in slums now btw
24/03/25, 9:50 pm - OG Ojas: His upcoming generations weren't of cowards but brave warriors

24/03/25, 9:50 pm - Agrim: Where are they?
24/03/25, 9:51 pm - OG Ojas: They are treated like kings in Maharashtra
24/03/25, 9:51 pm - OG Ojas: Search it up on google
24/03/25, 9:51 pm - Agrim: Theyre living like the japanese monarch or still like mughal descendants
24/03/25, 9:51 pm - OG Ojas: I am not sure about the location though
24/03/25, 9:53 pm - Agrim: Maratha ideology was better than mughals.
24/03/25, 9:53 pm - Agrim: Akbar bhi gadha thha but baki to chutiye thhe

24/03/25, 9:55 pm - OG Ojas: Just blocking and restricting these so called mughal supporters won't do the job they should be eliminated in front of the mosques
24/03/25, 9:55 pm - OG Ojas: Fucking terrorist mentality
24/03/25, 9:56 pm - OG Ojas: The son of Aurangzeb literally ran to Sambhaji Maharaj for protection from his father
24/03/25, 9:57 pm - OG Ojas: Sambhaji Maharaj was the person who could've ended the Mughal reign if he was not betrayed by his comrades
24/03/25, 10:00 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Disunity is the only cause of Indias struggle
24/03/25, 10:00 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Be it present or past
24/03/25, 10:00 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Fucking snitch
24/03/25, 10:05 pm - OG Ojas: Not only Sambhaji Maharaj a lot of rulers could've ended the rule centuries ago but they all were betrayed by their own comrades and later these so called comrades converted into chuslims and started to convert others into chuslims by force this is the true history of India which was hidden from us because of congress which was against the idea of printing the true history of India 
Akbar implemented the rules but never followed them I have done deep research on this so I hold solid points in what I am writing here the non chuslim womens were raped by chuslim males and there chuslim scholars said that Allah allows this 
Read about the real history someday and you will find out about how much our ancestors have done for us while these Mughals spread terrorism across the nation
24/03/25, 10:06 pm - OG Ojas: So called secularism is the main cause if only Hindustan was just for Hindus
24/03/25, 10:07 pm - OG Ojas: Chuslims kabhi bhi hindu chuslim bhai bhai karne lagte hai aur kabhi bhi hinduo ko bad mouth karte hai
24/03/25, 10:08 pm - OG Ojas: A teen age girl was raped by chuslims for not being a Chuslim and here tatto of 🕉️ was washed off by acid

24/03/25, 10:10 pm - OG Ojas: In the reign of Chatrapati kingdom women were treated as prestigious goddesses and Mughals literally slept with their own daughters
24/03/25, 10:11 pm - OG Ojas: True lol
24/03/25, 10:11 pm - OG Ojas: I hope that Hindus can understand this cause whoever supports hindu chuslim bhai bhai has to know the reality
24/03/25, 10:12 pm - OG Ojas: There are some Muslims who know that their religion is wrong and proudly say Jai Shree Ram
24/03/25, 10:13 pm - OG Ojas: And bruh Insta is full of this kind of content so whatever there is not something new

24/03/25, 11:50 pm - OG Ojas: It is not like I am dying for her
24/03/25, 11:50 pm - Agrim: But isnt she your love
24/03/25, 11:50 pm - OG Ojas: She still is

24/03/25, 11:51 pm - Agrim: OBJECTIFICATION ALERT ⚠️ MISOGYNY DETECTED
24/03/25, 11:51 pm - OG Ojas: So if she ever finds a guy better than me I am happy to leave her

24/03/25, 11:52 pm - OG Ojas: I don't want her to think of me as a jerk but an individual to whom she can look upon

24/03/25, 11:55 pm - OG Ojas: Even though I am a total dark humoured guy who will literally joke around the whole time with you guys I prefer to be a very kind and low esteemed guy in front of her
24/03/25, 11:56 pm - OG Ojas: At the end of 8th I got her a valentine's ring
24/03/25, 11:56 pm - Agrim: Tf when?
24/03/25, 11:57 pm - OG Ojas: Which she accepted but later cried because she thought that I was just too perfect for her and she doesn't deserve me so I decided that I will stand on an equal footing with her supporting her through and through

25/03/25, 1:31 pm - OG Ojas: Dad joke
25/03/25, 1:32 pm - OG Ojas: Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt

03/04/25, 7:04 pm - arjuncodess: ### **Title Justification**  
The title **"With the Photographer"** makes sense because the whole chapter is about the narrator’s experience with a photographer. The word **"with"** shows that the narrator is directly involved in the process. It also hints at a clash between the two. The photographer wants a perfect picture, while the narrator wants to stay real. This title tells us that the story will focus on their interaction. It is simple, clear, and fits the theme.  

### **Theme Justification**  
The chapter shows a fight between **perfectionism** and **realism**. The photographer wants to edit every detail to make the picture perfect. The narrator does not like this. He believes photos should show real faces, not fake ones. This theme makes us think about how people change things to look better, even when it’s not needed. It also shows how different people see beauty. The photographer sees perfection as beauty, but the narrator sees truth as beauty.

03/04/25, 7:38 pm - OG Ojas: Criticism
03/04/25, 7:38 pm - arjuncodess: ### **Title Justification**  
The title **"With the Photographer"** fits because the story is about the narrator’s time with a photographer. The word **"with"** hints at their interaction and differences. The photographer is **eccentric**, obsessed with **artistic perfection**, while the narrator believes in **self-acceptance** and reality. The title sets up the clash between their views. It also makes readers curious—what happens in this meeting? The simplicity of the title mirrors the narrator’s straightforward thinking, while the deeper meaning reflects the photographer’s need for control over art.  

### **Theme Justification**  
This chapter highlights the struggle between **artistic perfection** and **self-acceptance**. The photographer is **eccentric**, focusing on fixing every flaw. He believes perfection makes art beautiful. The narrator, however, values reality and self-acceptance. He does not want to hide his true face. This theme shows how people see beauty differently. Some chase perfection, while others embrace their flaws. It also makes us think—should art change reality or show it as it is? The story questions whether perfection is necessary or if being real is enough.

03/04/25, 7:58 pm - arjuncodess: Here are the answers based on the provided text:



1) **Where was the narrator? Why had he gone there? Why do you think that there was a certain pride in the photographer’s manner?**  

   - The narrator was in a **photo studio** to get his **photograph taken**.  

   - The photographer showed **a certain pride in his manner** because he had **heavily edited the narrator’s photograph**, altering his features to fit his own artistic vision. He was proud of his editing skills and believed he had improved the narrator’s appearance.



2) **What does the word ‘proof’ mean in this context? Why did the narrator ask, “Is it me?”**  

   - ‘Proof’ in this context refers to **a trial or test print of the photograph before making the final version**.  

   - The narrator asked, **“Is it me?”** because the **photographer had drastically changed his facial features**, making him look completely unrecognizable.



3) **Which of the narrator’s facial features had the photographer altered?**  

   - The photographer had altered the **eyebrows, mouth, ears, and facial hair**.  

   - He removed the narrator’s original eyebrows and drew new ones, adjusted his mouth, removed facial hair, and even suggested removing his ear to replace it with an artificial one.



4) **What was the only part of the narrator’s face that seemed original in the photograph?**  

   - Nothing seemed original in the photograph, as **almost every part of his face was edited**. The photographer had changed so much that the narrator no longer recognized himself.



5) **At the end of the story, the narrator flies into a rage. What makes him angry? How would you justify the narrator’s angry outburst?**  

   - The narrator was **angry** because the **photographer had completely changed his appearance**, prioritizing his editing skills over capturing the narrator’s real face. The narrator had wanted a simple, natural photograph that would remind his friends of him after his death, but the photographer ignored his wishes.  

   - His **anger is justified** because he felt **disrespected and unseen**—his face was not merely a thing to be fixed but a part of his identity. The photographer's excessive alterations made the narrator feel like a stranger in his own photograph.

03/04/25, 9:02 pm - OG Ojas: And most probably will only need some shooting advantages
03/04/25, 9:03 pm - OG Ojas: And a defender never dribbles only clears the ball or creates spaces so is this what you need ?
03/04/25, 9:05 pm - OG Ojas: And do you want studs which will enhance your speed or you need the ones which will only get you to defend properly
03/04/25, 9:06 pm - OG Ojas: I mean a defender doesn't need speed cause they should always mark the player
03/04/25, 9:06 pm - OG Ojas: And besides the speed difference will be of some milliseconds so not to even get flustered about that

04/04/25, 5:16 pm - Pratyuush 👽: Aa rha mai
04/04/25, 5:16 pm - arjuncodess: ### **1) What did the photographer do? Why was he in the machine only for a second? What was frantic for apparently?**  
The photographer rolled a machine into the center of the room and crawled into it from behind. He was inside the machine for only a second because he was adjusting the focus or preparing the camera for the photograph. He appeared frantic because he was concentrating on setting up the shot quickly and efficiently.  

### **2) Why did the narrator keep still when the photographer crawled back into the machine again? How did the photographer look when he came out at last?**  
The narrator kept still because he thought it was necessary for the photograph to be taken properly. He assumed that any movement might ruin the picture. When the photographer finally came out, he looked satisfied, as if he had completed his work successfully.  

### **3) What did the photographer remark about the narrator’s face then? How did the narrator respond? What made him glad?**  
The photographer criticized the narrator’s face, pointing out various flaws such as his ears and mouth. He suggested adjusting them to make the portrait look better. The narrator was annoyed and insulted by these remarks but did not argue. He was glad when the session was finally over and he could leave.  

### **4) Towards the end of the story, what was the reaction of the narrator on receiving the photograph? Why did he react in such a manner? Why does he call the photograph a ‘worthless bauble’?**  
When the narrator received the photograph, he was shocked and disappointed. The photographer had altered his face so much that he could not recognize himself. He reacted with frustration because the photograph did not represent him at all. He called it a ‘worthless bauble’ because it was meaningless to him—it was no longer his real face, just an artificial version created by the photographer.  

### **5) What do you think about the photographer from his activities in the extract? Give one reason to support your answer. What is the theme of the story “With the Photographer”?**  
The photographer seems overly focused on technical perfection rather than capturing the subject’s true likeness. He is critical and insensitive, making unnecessary changes to the narrator’s face. This shows that he prioritizes his artistic vision over the emotions of his customers.  

The theme of the story revolves around **vanity, the unrealistic standards of beauty, and the frustration of not being seen for who we truly are**. It highlights how people try to alter reality to fit an idealized version, often leading to dissatisfaction.
